# Nerdery Overnight Challenge Mixer Planning Notes

## Speed-dating Mixer

- Talked to 1 or 2 people from every non-profit for 7 minutes each
- It was kinda crazy + exhuasting
- We were able to rate each other, but we think the nonprofits have more of a say in who they work with
- In case it wasn’t clear before, we won’t know who we are working with until day of

### Takeaways

- Plan on not having reliable WiFi
- Everything seemed to lean toward PHP + WordPress, but we are still free to do whatever we want
- We can work on any server or development/staging environment we wish
- 1 year of free hosting from [ip•House internet professionals](https://iphouse.com/web-hosting/web-hosting-pricing)
- We also have until XX to move everything to production server
- From the vets: have something concrete early + plan on getting a couple naps in
- Nonprofits are expected to prepare by culling content + collecting all their account credentials
- Anything we do will be greatly appreciated + lightyears ahead of where they are today
- From Dave: Show up with 5 themes already setup they can choose from
- Final thought: show up with WordPress stack or equivalent

## High Level Problems

1. What specific things can we do to prepare?
2. Configuration vs. Craftsmanship
3. How do we keep the non-profit people busy for 24 hours?
4. How do we effectively delegate to make sure we each have a balanced workload?
5. We need to walk in ready to work, not tinker


## Common Technical Scope

Specific problems we should be preparing to solve common to all non-profits.

Please capture any thoughts you have about possible solutions or libraries + tools you have experience with.

### Content Management System (not CMS)

- simple interface for adding + editing pages + posts
- password protected with at least one superuser (some desire many users)
- ability to upload photos + videos
- site-wide search should be included
- education to effectively use all these things is of equal importance

### Metadata + Search Engine Optimization (not SEO)

- this includes everything from proper URLs tied to categories + tagging to any magic our marketing people can apply

### Event Management + Calendar

- internal management interface for the nonprofit
- external display for site visitors to browse
- login to register for event (3rd-party integration may be best)

### Accept Donations

- many have existing Paypal, Square, Stripe implementations
- many wish to avoid using Paypal or incurring high fees if possible

### Social Media Integration

- we should really shine in this department, and whether we only use branded buttons that link to their profiles or incorporate feeds or help them with their strategy is on us to excercise leadership
- we didn’t hype the Sprout Social account perk too much, that will be available to them

### Mobile-friendly

No need for native apps (sorry, Erik!), but the site we deliver should be optimized for mobile devices.


## Unique Scope

Specific problems we should be aware of but 1/12 chance that we’ll have to deal with them.

1. Ticketing design, sales, and strategy, currently using Paypal (NAJWA Dance Corps)
2. Migrate existing site from Weebly + deal with CPS rules (Pilsen Community Academy)
3. Migrate existing site from [RebelMouse](https://rebelmouse.com) (1FUR1)
4. eCommerce to sell hoodies (Project Seth)
5. Conference registration system + maintain existing MYSQL database (American Model UN)
6. Integrations with Caspio book database, Tiki-Toki, Shopfy + Constant Contact (Brown Baby Reads)
7. Keep Drupal back-end (Chicago Artists Coalition)
8. Migrate existing site from Joomla (Chicago Youth Shakespeare)
9. Chess tournament registration + results (Chicago Chess Foundation)
10. Google Maps integration

## Story

Our biggest priority is to help them tell their story as accurately + effectively as possible.

### Audience

- this site is a marketing + awareness tool for every nonprofit
- donors

### Branding

- we are only expected to deliver a website, but flexibility with branding is good for everyone
- ranges from greenfield (aka license to do whatever we think is best) to definitely keep the existing logo to they aren’t sure, but they trust us
- any branding assets we create should be packaged + delivered (probably through the website itself) for use on other collateral as well *note: we don’t have to create this collateral, but .pngs + .eps files with some built-in whitespace may be helpful*

### Content

- all over the place
